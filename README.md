# Introduction-of-myself

I am Jiali Ma, a post-graduate from Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences,now I work in Shenyang ,Liaoning,Northeast China.
I love Python programming and have developed platforms for data processing and visualizing using PyQt and Qt Designer.
I believe mother nature , the universe, are unlimited,mysterious and beautiful,and technology ,like programming,is what gets people closer to them.
I registered Github for recording ,learning, exploring and sharing.
By the way,Albert Einstein is my favorite genius and the greatest physicist.^_^
